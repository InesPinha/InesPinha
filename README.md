👋 Hi, I’m Inês Piedade

I have been programming professionally since 2014.

In addition to my professional experience, I consider myself a responsible person, very organized, who likes new challenges and is eager to progress.

I am pleased to promote a collaborative environment where the entire team feels good.

I have always worked 4 days per week in order to reconcile with the voluntary service that I perform and value.
